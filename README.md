# imagine-if

Imagine that you are a knight and you just got back from battle. You would like to stay if this motel that was nearby and your troops are staying with you. So the program will welcome the user as a knight. You will make up a name as if that is the title you go by. When creating the name, it will ask the user to input their name and then a characteristic. Once that is established, the program will continue to call you that name, so I hope you come up with a good name. After the program gets you selected name, It will prompt you on how many servings of different foods for you and your troops. After you have given the owner the amount that you would like them to prepare, the worker will tell you how much the food would have been if you were paying, but you as a knight, will not have to pay because you have fought in the battle and they are giving you the food as a thank you.
